# Daily Coding Questions Repository

Welcome to my Daily Coding Questions Repository! This repository contains a collection of coding questions that I solve on a daily basis to improve my problem-solving skills and coding abilities.

## Motivation

I started this project with the aim to challenge myself and maintain a consistent coding practice routine. By solving coding questions daily, I can reinforce my knowledge of algorithms and data structures and enhance my problem-solving techniques.

## Usage

Each day, I will add a new coding question to the repository with its solution in the programming language of my choice. You can explore the questions and solutions by navigating through the directories and files. Feel free to use the code for learning purposes or as a reference.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each day's coding question. Within each directory, you will find the coding question itself, the solution, and any additional resources used to solve the problem.

## Coding Language

I majorly use Java as my programming language for the solutions. Sometimes, I might change the language and the choice of language for each question may vary based on the nature of the problem and my personal preferences.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you want to add new coding questions or improve existing solutions, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your modifications and add your new question/solution.
4. Submit a pull request, explaining the changes you made.

I will review the pull request and merge it if it aligns with the goals of the project.
