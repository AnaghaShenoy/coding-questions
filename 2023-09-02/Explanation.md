## Problem Statement

The given problem involves maximizing the count of leaf nodes that can be visited in a binary tree under a given budget constraint. The cost of visiting a leaf node is equal to its level (depth) in the tree.

## Solution Explanation

### Input Parsing and Tree Building:

- The `main` function in the `GFG` class reads input and builds a binary tree from a serialized string representation of the tree.
- The input string is split into an array, and the tree is constructed using a queue for level-order traversal.
- The `Node` class represents the nodes of the binary tree.

### Tree Traversal and Counting:

- The `Solution` class contains the `getCount` method, which takes two parameters: a `Node` representing the root of the tree and an integer `bud` representing the budget.
- The solution follows these steps to maximize the count of visited leaf nodes:
  1. Initialize a queue `q` to perform level-order traversal.
  2. Initialize two integers `count` to keep track of the count of visited leaf nodes and `cost` to represent the current level of the tree (starting from 1).
  3. Use a `while` loop to perform level-order traversal:
     - Get the number of nodes at the current level (level `cost`) using the size of the queue.
     - Iterate through these nodes:
       - Poll (remove) a node from the queue.
       - Check if the budget `bud` becomes zero. If it does, exit the loop because the budget is exhausted.
       - Check if the current node is a leaf node (both left and right children are null) and if the budget `bud` is greater than or equal to the current `cost`. If both conditions are met, increment the `count` and subtract the `cost` from the budget.
       - If the current node has a left child, add it to the queue.
       - If the current node has a right child, add it to the queue.
     - Increment the `cost` to move to the next level of the tree.
  4. Return the `count` as the result, which represents the maximum count of leaf nodes that can be visited within the given budget.

### Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we perform a level-order traversal of the tree, visiting each node once.

### Space Complexity Analysis

The space complexity is determined by the space used by the queue `q`. In the worst case, the queue can contain all the leaf nodes at the maximum level of the tree, which is O(N) in terms of space complexity.

Overall, the solution efficiently calculates the maximum count of leaf nodes that can be visited within the given budget by traversing the binary tree in a level-order manner and considering the cost of visiting each leaf node.
