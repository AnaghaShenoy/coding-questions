## Approach:

The goal of the solution is to merge two strings, `word1` and `word2`, alternately character by character. To achieve this, we iterate through both strings, appending characters from each string alternately until we reach the end of either string. After the loop, we append any remaining characters from both strings.

1. Initialize a `StringBuilder` named `ans` to store the merged result.
2. Get the lengths of `word1` and `word2` and store them in `n` and `m` respectively.
3. Initialize an index variable `i` to 0.
4. While `i` is less than `n` and `i` is less than `m`, do the following:
   - Append the character at index `i` from `word1` to `ans`.
   - Append the character at index `i` from `word2` to `ans`.
   - Increment `i`.
5. After the loop, append any remaining characters from `word1` (from index `i` to `n`) to `ans`.
6. Append any remaining characters from `word2` (from index `i` to `m`) to `ans`.
7. Convert the `StringBuilder` `ans` to a `String` and return it as the final merged result.

## Time Complexity (TC):

The time complexity of this solution is O(max(n, m)), where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`. In the worst case, we need to iterate through both strings entirely to merge them alternately.

## Space Complexity (SC):

The space complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`. The space is used to store the merged result in the `StringBuilder`. Additionally, a few integer variables are used, which occupy constant space.

## Summary:

The solution efficiently merges two strings alternately by iterating through them and appending characters in the required order. The time complexity is determined by the length of the longer string, and the space complexity depends on the combined length of both strings.
